# What is a Project?

üîç In the **DTU Biosustain Data Catalog**, a project is a structured space, where you can **organize**, **manage**, and **document** your research activities in one place.

Each project also includes user roles with different permissions, so you can control who can ***view***, ***edit***, or ***create*** new datasets. For example, some users may be able to edit datasets but not create new ones, while others may have view-only access. 

A project serves as a record of your work, making it easier to: 

 -  Understand the **purpose** and **scope** of the research
 -  Know the **data** it contains
 -  Track the **technologies** used
 -  Know **where** the data is stored
 -  See **who** is involved 
 -  Access any relevant **datasets**, **documentation** or **notes**


 Project in the Data Catalog make you research **organized**, **searchable**, and **accessible** to collaborators and future users.

# Add a Resource
To add one or more Resources to the dataset, follow the next steps:

## Step 1: Find your Dataset
Click on the `View your datasets` button located under the search bar on the Data Catalog welcome page to find the dataset you want to add a resource to.

_For detailed instructions, see **Step 1 & Step 2** in the [**Update Dataset**](this_is_the_reference_point) guide._


## Step 2: Click Manage
On the Dataset home page, click `Manage` button located in the ***top-right corner***.

## Step 5: Fill out Resource Info
Provide details about your resource by completing any of the available fields, such as:
* File: Choose either to `Upload (a)` a file or to include a `Link (b)` as a resource for your dataset. (These options are shown in the picture below to help them identify them easily.)
* Description
* Format: The file format of the resource, e.g. CSV, XSL, PDF, etc.
* Creator Email



```{tip}
While none of the fields are required to create a resource, it is a **good practice** to fill out any of the above fields, based on any relevant information you may have.
Even if you're unsure about some details, you can always **include what you know** and **update the info later** if needed.

```{admonition} Add Multiple File Attachments
:class: toggle
:collapsible:

You can add **more** resource **files** before saving. After uploading the first file, click the `Add more files` button to include additional files in the same form. 

These files are treated as a **single** resource with **multiple attachments**.

This is useful when you have several related files (e.g. different sheets or formats) that belong together.

## Step 6: Save your Resources
Click `Add` located in the ***bottom-right corner*** of the page to save your resource(s).
After saving, you’ll be redirected to the dataset’s home page, where all added resources will be listed.

```


```{admonition} Save & Add Another Resource
:class: toggle
:collapsible:

Click the `Save & Add another` button at the bottom of the page to save the current resource and immediately open a new resource form. 

This allows you to **continue adding resources** (files or links) **without leaving the resource creation page**.

Each resource added this way is **independent**.

## After Adding a Resource
Once you saved your resource(s), you'll be redirected to the dataset's home page, where all added resources will be listed under the ***Dataset and Resources*** section.

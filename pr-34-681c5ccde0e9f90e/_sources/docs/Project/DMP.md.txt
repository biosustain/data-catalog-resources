# Data Management Plan

The **Data Management Plan (DMP)** helps you describe how your project’s data will be handled during the project and after it is completed. It ensures compliance and supports good research practices.

You can access the DMP from your project's home page under the **DMP tab**.

```{tip}
Most fields here are automatically filled and extracted from the information you provided during project or dataset creation. You only need to review and add any missing details.
```

## How to complete the DMP

The DMP is divided into several section(s). Each group contains fields that either:

* **Require your input**: Information such as funding details and storage location

    or

* **Auto-filled by the system**: Based on the information provided during project and dataset creation (e.g., project name, description, ID)

Let's look at each group in detail:


### 1. Project Details

This section provides general information about the project:

   * **Project Identifier**: A unique ID for your project generated by the system

   * **Project Title & Description**

   * **Contact Persons**: Project Creator, PI, Collaborator

   * **Project creation & end date**

   * **Funding information**: Funding source and grant details

   * **LIMS (Benchling) project**: Indicate if there is a Benchling project to link

### 2. Data Collection

This section covers what data you collect and how it is generated:

   * **Existing Data**: State if you use pre-existing datasets

   * **Dataset Identifier**: A unique ID for your dataset generated by the system

   * **Dataset Title & Description**

   * **Dataset Creator**

   * **Dataset Created Date**

   * **Access Rights**: Define who can access the dataset → *(For more details see [**Access Controlled**](this_is_the_reference_point).)*

        * Restricted
        * BRIGHT-visible 

   * **Dataset Type**: Specify the type of the data:

        * Raw
        * Processed
        * Results

   * **Resource Type**: The type of experiment or analytical approach that produced the data, such as:

        * DNA sequencing
        * RNA sequencing
        * Proteomics (DIA)

   * **Instrument**: List the instrument or equipment used to generate the data such as:

        * MiSeq (illumina)
        * NextSeq (illumina)
        * GridION (Nanopore)

### 3. Data Storage & Backup

*(All fields in this section require your input!)*

This section covers questions about how and where your data will be stored and backed up during and after the project is finished:

   * **Main & Other Data storage**: Specify the main storage and any secondary location.

   * **Physical data location**: Indicate where physical copies (if any) are stored.

   * **Backup solutions**: Describe any other backup solution (e.g., *Additional backups on my personal laptop are stored on an external hard drive*).


```{note}
Be aware that if you store data in **DTU M-drive** or **DTU personal OneDrive**, your data **WILL BE DELETED** after your employment ends.
```


### 4. Documentation 

*(The field in this section require your input!)*

Provide details about project documentation:

* **Documentation**: List documentation formats

 **Example**: All electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) will be stored in Benchling project folder 'Microbial_soil_community'. Whenever applicable, a README file will be created for each dataset, detailing the data collection methods, processing steps, and any relevant metadata.

### 5. Data Sharing, Access & Compliance

*(All fields in this section require your input, except for the last one!)*

This section includes questions about compliance and data sharing:

* **Biological Material / Hazardous Substances:**: State if your project involves these

* **Personal Data (GDPR)**: State if personal or sensitive data is involved

* **Access Controlled in Data Catalog**: Choose who can view your data:

    * Restricted
    * BRIGHT-visible 

* **Sharing After Project Ends**: Specify if data will be made public after completion

→ **Restricted**: Access for all project, dataset metadata and files in Microsoft Azure Storage account is restricted to project members and collaborators.

→ **BRIGHT-visible**: READ-ONLY access for project and dataset metadata is granted to all BRIGHT employees. Access to files in Microsoft Azure Storage account remains restricted to project members and collaborators.

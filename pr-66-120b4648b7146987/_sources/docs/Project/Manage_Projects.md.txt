# Manage Projects

This guide shows you how to manage Data Catalog Projects to keep research data structured and accessible. After a project is created, you can either **edit** its details, **archive** it, or **manage user permissions** to control access and collaboration.


➤ *Follow the steps below based on the action you want to perform.*


## Step 1: Find the Project
Use the search bar in the ***top navigation*** to find your project. Just type the project name and, if needed, add filters to refine your search results.


## Step 2: Choose an Action
On the Project home page, click on the Metadata tab, where you will find two action buttons:

* Click **`Edit metadata`**, located ***right above*** the list of project metadata, to update project details

    **or**

* Click **`Archive`**, located on the ***top-right corner*** of the page, to archive the project



## Step 3: Confirm
➤ If you choose to **`Edit metadata`**: 

After making the necessary updates, click:
   * <span style="color:#00C48C">Save</span> to apply your changes

       **or**

   * <span style="color:#FF4D4F">Cancel</span> to discard them


➤ If you choose to **`Archive`**: 

A confirmation box will appear asking you to confirm the action.

## Manage Projects User Permissions

As the project creator, you have full control over the project, including its datasets and user access. You can add users and assign permissions through the **Permissions** tab on the project home page.


### How the permissions Tab Works
The tab displays a table view with:

* **User column:** Lists all users. Your name appears at the top, followed by any additional users you add.
* **Permissions columns:** Show the available permissions:
    * **Can Edit Permissions:** Allows managing user access and permissions
    * **Can Edit Metadata:** Allows editing project details
    * **Can Add Datasets:** Allows adding datasets to the project, either by creating new or adding (and removing) existing ones (see also: {ref}`Datasets-tab`)
    * **Can Archive:** Allows archiving the project 
* **Actions column:** Includes the available actions:  
    * **Save Policy:** Saves changes when adding a new user
    * **Remove Policy:** Revokes a user's access



### Adding or Removing Users

* To **add a new user**, click **`Add user policy`**, enter their details (first name and last name), select the permissions you want to grant, and click the <img src="../../_static/images/save_icon.png" alt="open_icon" style="height:1.2em; vertical-align:text-bottom;"> icon to save your user policy.
* To **remove a user policy**, click the <img src="../../_static/images/delete.png" alt="open_icon" style="height:1.2em; vertical-align:text-bottom;"> icon in the action column.

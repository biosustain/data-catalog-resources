# What is a Project?

üîç A project in the **DTU Biosustain Data Catalog** helps you **organize**, **manage**, and **document** your research activities in a **structured**, **searchable** format. 

Each project includes certain users with different levels of permission, enabling them to perform different actions. For example, some users may be able to edit datasets but not create new ones, while others may only view datasets. 

A project serves as a record of your work and includes a home page, that helps others understand, among other things:

 -  The ***purpose*** and ***scope*** of the project
 -  The ***data*** it contains
 -  The ***technologies*** used
 -  ***Where*** the data is stored
 -  ***Who*** is involved 
 -  Any relevant ***documentation*** or ***notes***


 Project in the Data Catalog helps ensure your research is clearly **documented**, **easy to navigate**, and **accessible** to collaborators and future users.

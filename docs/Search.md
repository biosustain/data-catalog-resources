# Search

The Data Catalog makes it easy to find projects and datasets quickly using keywords and filters. This guide explains the search options available.

## ➤  Basic Search
At the top of the page, you will find the **`Search bar`**. Simply type any relevant keyword such as the project or dataset name, and the Data Catalog will display matching results.

→ The **search** is designed to handle typos and partial matches. Even if you enter an incorrect or incomplete term, the Data Catalog will still try to return the **most relevant results** based on what you intended to search for.

```{note} 
Results are ranked by **relevance** by default, so the most likely matches appear first. 
You can change the sorting order using the **`Order by`** dropdown located on the top right corner of that section. For example, sort by ***name*** (ascending or descending) or by ***last modified***.

**This feature is still under development and might not work as expected yet!*
```

## ➤  Advanced Search

For more precise results, you can use the Advanced search. It helps you narrow down your results by applying filters, making it easier to find what you are looking for.

Available filters include:

* **Archive Status:** Choose from ***Active***, ***Archived*** or ***All***
* **Entity Type:** Select whether you want ***Projects & Datasets***, ***Projects only*** or ***Datasets only***
* **Entity Name:** If you know the exact name you can type it here
* **Owner:** Filter by the owner of the project or dataset
* **Metadata:** Use metadata tags for more precise filtering

```{tip} 
To make your search more precise, try combining **multiple filters** at once.

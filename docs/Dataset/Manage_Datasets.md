# Manage Datasets

Managing Datasets in the Data Catalog is similar to managing Projects: you can **edit** details of metadata or **archive** datasets when they are no longer needed. The steps are almost the same, but here we focus more on the dataset aspect.

➤ *Follow the steps below based on the action you want to perform.*


## Step 1: Locate your Dataset
Use the search bar in the ***top navigation*** to find your project.


## Step 2: Choose an Action
On the Dataset home page, click on the Metadata tab, where you will find two action buttons:

* Click **`Edit metadata`**, located ***on the top*** of the metadata section, to update dataset details 

    **or**

* Click **`Archive`**, always located on the ***top-right corner*** of the page, to archive the dataset



## Step 3: Confirm
➤ If you choose to **`Edit metadata`**: 

After making the necessary updates, click:
   * <span style="color:#00C48C">Save</span> to apply your changes 

       **or**

   * <span style="color:#FF4D4F">Cancel</span> to discard them


➤ If you choose to **`Archive`**: 

A confirmation box will appear asking you to confirm the action.

```{admonition} Archived Datasets
:class: toggle
:collapsible:

→ Archived datasets remain visible under the **Archived** section on the Datasets Overview page. You can open and view them, but they cannot be edited unless you first click the **`Restore`** button on the dataset home page.

→ They also appear under the **Datasets** tab on the project home page it is linked to. This is indicated by this <img src="../../_static/images/archived_icon.png" alt="open_icon" style="height:1.2em; vertical-align:text-bottom;"> icon displayed next to the dataset name. If you hover over the icon, a note appears explaining that the dataset is archived.<br/>

→ If you unlink the archived dataset from the project, it will only appear on the Datasets Overview page.

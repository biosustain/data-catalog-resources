```{tip}
While only a few fields are required to create a dataset, we **strongly recommend** filling out additional fields, based on any relevant information you may have.

Providing more context helps ensure your dataset is easier to **understand**, **discover**, and **reuse**, both for yourself and others.

Even if you're unsure about some details, you can always **include what you know** and **update the dataset info later** if needed.
```


## Step 4: Save
Click `Save` located in the ***bottom-right corner*** of the page to submit your dataset.

# Files

**Files** are the smallest data units in the system. Each file belongs to a dataset and represents a single piece of data, such as a sequence file, image, table, or model output in a specific format. Every file has a unique identifier, a defined format (e.g., .fastq, .csv, .tiff, .h5), and metadata that describes its content and origin.


## Upload Files

Once your dataset has been successfully created in Data Catalog, you can start adding files or directories directly from the dataset's home page. The upload section is located on the right side of the page and it supports multiple upload options for flexibility.


There are three options available:

1.  **`Drag & Drop`** files from your computer into the upload area
2.  Click **`Choose files`** to select individual files from your local storage
    or
3.  Click **`Choose directory`** to upload an entire folder (ideal for keeping related files together)

```{tip}
When uploading a directory, the folder structure is preserved for better organization.
```


➤ Once uploaded, files will appear in the list with details such as **name**, and **upload date**, making it easy to keep track of its content.


## Manage Files

After uploading, you can **download** files to view details or **delete** files if they are no longer needed by using the respective icons.



```{note}
**Deleting** a file does not permanently remove it. The file is **soft deleted**, meaning it is hidden and no longer appears in the Data Catalog or search results. If you need to **recover** or **fully delete** a file, please contact the RDM team.

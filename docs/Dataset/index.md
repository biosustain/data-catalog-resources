# Dataset  <!-- This is the sidebar title -->
In the Data Catalog, a **dataset** is a collection of data and information that helps describe and share your research.

Each dataset includes:

* **Metadata:** basic information such as the title, description, tags, etc.

You can use datasets to:

* **Organize** your research data in one place.
* **Explain** the purpose and content of the data.
* **Share** data with others in a controlled way.
* Make your data easier to **find** and **reuse**.

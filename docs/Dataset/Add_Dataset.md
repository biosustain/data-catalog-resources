# Create a New Dataset

This guide walks you through the steps for creating a new dataset in the Data Catalog, including:
* Link with the correct Parent Project
* How to fill in the metadata
* Submit it correctly
* Upload files & directories, once successfully submitted


## Step 1: Navigate to the Datasets Overview Page 
* Click the **`Datasets`** button on the Data Catalog welcome page 

    **or** 

* Use the **`Datasets`** tab located at the top of any page.

Both options will take you to the Datasets overview page, where you can browse, or create a new datasets.


## Step 2: Add a New Dataset
On the Datasets overview page, click the **`Add a new dataset`** button located right below the ***Search*** bar.


```{note}
There are fields on the dataset creation page that are automatically generated by the platform, such as **Dataset Identifier**, **Dataset Creator** and **Access Rights**. These fields cannot be changed.
```


## Step 3: Choose a Parent Project
Select a project from the list to link your dataset. If needed, you can unlink the dataset at any time.


```{tip}
Choosing a Parent Project ***links*** your dataset to the project it belongs to. This ensures your data stays organized, easy to find and correctly associated. 
```



## Step 4: Fill in Dataset Metadata
Complete all the required fields marked with **`*`**:

* Dataset Title
* Dataset Type:
    * Raw
    * Processed
    * Results



## Final Step: Submit your Dataset
Click `Create dataset` at the ***bottom*** of the page to submit your dataset.


```{tip}
While only a few fields are required to create a dataset, we **strongly recommend** filling in additional fields, based on any relevant information you may have.

Providing more context helps ensure your dataset is easier to **understand**, **discover**, and **reuse**, both for yourself and others.

Even if you're unsure about some details, you can always **include what you know** and **update the dataset info later** if needed.
```

## Uploading Files

Once your dataset has been successfully created in Data Catalog, you can start adding files or directories directly from the dataset's home page. The upload section is located on the right side of the page and it supports multiple upload options for flexibility.


There are three options available:
* **`Drag & Drop`** files from your computer into the upload area
* Click **`Choose files`** to select individual files from your local storage
    or
* Click **`Choose directory`** to upload an entire folder (ideal for keeping related files together)

```{tip}
When uploading a directory, the folder structure is preserved for better organization.
```


➤ Once uploaded, files will appear in the list with details such as **name**, and **upload date**, making it easy to keep track of its content.

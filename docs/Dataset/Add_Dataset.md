# Create a New Dataset

This guide walks you through the steps to create a new dataset in the Data Catalog.

```{note}
There are fields on the dataset creation page that are automatically generated by the system, such as **Dataset Identifier**, **Dataset Creator** and **Access Rights**. Some of these fields cannot be changed.
```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Datasets Overview Page 
Both of the following options will take you to the Datasets overview page, where you can create a new dataset:

* Click the **`Datasets`** button on the Data Catalog welcome page 

    **or** 

* Use the **`Datasets`** tab located at the top of any page.


## Step 2: Add a New Dataset
On the Datasets overview page, click the **`Add a new dataset`** button located right below the ***Search*** bar.


## Step 3: Choose a Parent Project
Select a project from the list to link your dataset. If needed, you can unlink the dataset at any time.


```{tip}
Choosing a Parent Project ***links*** your dataset to the project it belongs to. This ensures your data stays organized, easy to find and correctly associated. 
```



## Step 4: Fill in Dataset Metadata
Complete all the required fields marked with **`*`**:

* Dataset Title (`*`)
* Dataset Description
* Dataset Type (`*`):
    * Raw
    * Processed
    * Results
* Resource Type
* Instrument

```{note}
→ **Resource Type**: The type of experiment or analytical approach that produced the data (e.g., DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, Proteomics (DIA)).<br/>

→ **Instrument**: The equipment used to generate the data (e.g., MiSeq (Illumina), NextSeq (Illumina), GridION (Nanopore)).
```

## Final Step: Complete your Dataset
Click `Create dataset` at the ***bottom*** of the page to complete the process.

```{tip}
→ While only a few fields are required to create a dataset, we **strongly recommend** filling in additional fields, based on any relevant information you may have.

→ Providing more context makes your dataset easier to **understand**, **discover**, and **reuse**, both for you and others.

→ If you are unsure about some details, you can always **include what you know** and **update the dataset info later** if needed.

# Create a New Dataset

This guide walks you through the steps to create a new dataset in the Data Catalog.

```{note}
There are fields on the dataset creation page that are automatically generated by the system, such as **Dataset Identifier**, **Dataset Creator** and **Access Rights**. Some of these fields cannot be changed.
```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Dataset List Page 
Both of the following options will take you to the Dataset List page, where you can create a new dataset:

* Click the **`Datasets`** button on the Data Catalog welcome page 

    **or** 

* Use the **`Datasets`** tab located at the top of any page.


## Step 2: Add a New Dataset
On the Dataset List page, click the **`Add a new dataset`** button located right below the ***Search*** bar.


## Step 3: Choose a Parent Project
Select a project from the list to link your dataset. If needed, you can unlink the dataset at any time.


```{tip}
Choosing a Parent Project ***links*** your dataset to the project it belongs to. This ensures your data stays organized, easy to find and correctly associated. 
```



## Step 4: Fill in Dataset Metadata
Complete all the required fields marked with **`*`**:

* Dataset Title (`*`)
* Dataset Description
* Dataset Type (`*`):
    * Raw
    * Processed
    * Results
* Resource Type
* Instrument

```{note}
→ **Resource Type**: The type of experimental or analytical methodology that generates the data (e.g., DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, Proteomics (DIA)).<br/>

→ **Instrument**: The equipment used to generate the data (e.g., MiSeq (Illumina), NextSeq (Illumina), GridION (Nanopore)).
```

## Final Step: Complete your Dataset
Click `Create dataset` at the ***bottom*** of the page to complete the process.

```{tip}
→ While only a few fields are required to create a dataset, we **strongly recommend** filling in additional fields, based on any relevant information you may have.

→ Providing more context makes your dataset easier to **understand**, **discover**, and **reuse**, both for you and others.

→ If you are unsure about some details, you can always **include what you know** and **update the dataset info later** if needed.
```


-------------------------------------------


## Access Rights and Visibility 
Similar to projects, datasets have two access rights settings:

* **BRIGHT-visible:** 
    * Dataset metadata is visible (read-only) to all BRIGHT employees.

* **Restricted:** 
    * The dataset is completely hidden to all BRIGHT employees, except from users who have been explicitly granted permissions.

➣ By default, datasets as well as projects are set to **BRIGHT-visible**, but you can change the access rights when creating or editing a dataset.


Understanding how access rights affect visibility is important for collaboration:

```{note}

Users without assigned permissions (see {ref}`manage-dataset-user-permissions`) follow the dataset access rights:

→ For **BRIGHT-visible** dataset: Metadata is visible (read-only) to all BRIGHT employees

→ For **Restricted** datasets: Dataset is completely hidden

```

## Add Projects to Dataset

When you created the dataset, you already selected a "Parent project", which creates an initial relationship.
You can also **add** additional projects from the **Projects** tab on the dataset home page. 
This helps you associate the dataset with other research contexts.


```{note}
To add a project to a dataset, two conditions must be met:

→ You must have the **Can Add Datasets** permission on the project you want to add the dataset to
<br/>
→ You must have **access to the dataset** (either Bright-visible or through a dataset user permission, if it is restricted)

If either of these is missing, you will not be able to proceed.
```


### To add another project to a dataset:

1. Click the `Projects` tab on the dataset home page

2. Select the project you want to add from the list

3. Click `Link` to complete the process


To remove the relationship:

   * Click `Unlink`, and the project will be removed

```{note}
This relationship also appears under the **Datasets** tab on the **project** home page.
```

## Dataset Lineage

Once you have created a dataset you can define its **Lineage** by linkinng it to one or more datasets.

➣ Lineage creates a relationship that shows how datasets are related across different stages (e.g., raw → processed → results).

➣ It ensures **data provenance** by identifying source datasets when creating new ones (e.g., pipelines), supporting reproducibility.

```{important}
To create (or remove) a Dataset Lineage between datasets you must have the permission ***Can Link To*** on both datasets, otherwise you will not be able to perform this action or see the destination dataset in the linking list.
```


### To add a Lineage:

1. Click the `Lineage` tab on the dataset home page

2. Choose the relationship type:
    * `Add Ancestor`, if the selected dataset creates the current dataset

      **or** 

    * `Add Descendant`, if the selected dataset is a result of the current dataset

3. Select the dataset from the list

4. Add a description explaining the relationship (optional)

5. Click the `Add Ancestor` (or `Add Descendant`) button to complete the process


To remove a Lineage:

   * Click `Remove link from dataset`
   * Select the link and click `Delete`

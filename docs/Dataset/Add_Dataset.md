# Create a New Dataset
This guide walks you through the steps for creating a new dataset in the Data Catalog, including:
* How to fill in the metadata
* Submit it correctly
* Linked it with the correct Project
* Upload files & directories, once successfully submitted


## Step 1: Navigate to the Datasets Overview Page 
* Click the **`Datasets`** button on the Data Catalog welcome page <br/>
    **or** <br/>
* Use the **`Datasets`** tab located at the top of any page.

Both options will take you to the Datasets overview page, where you can browse, or create a new datasets.

## Step 2: Add a New Dataset
On the Datasets overview page, click the **`Add a new project`** button located right below the ***Search*** bar.

## Step 3: Fill in Dataset Metadata
Complete all the required fields marked with **`*`**:

* Dataset Title
* Dataset Description
* Dataset Type:
    * Raw
    * Processed
    * Results
* Resource Type:
    * DNA sequencing
    * RNA sequencing
    * Proteomics (DIA), etc.
* Instrument:
    * MiSeq (illumina)
    * NextSeq (illumina)
    * GridION (Nanopore), etc.


```{note}
The options for **Resource Type** and **Instrument** depend on the Dataset Type you select:<br/>

→ If you choose **Raw**, you'll see specific resource types (like DNA sequencing or Proteomics), each with its own instrument options. <br/>
→ If you choose **Processed**, you'll see a broader list of resource types, but no instrument options.<br>
→ If you choose **Results**, neither resource types nor instruments will be shown.<br/>

Some Resource Types and Instrument options may appear under more than one Dataset Type, while others are specific to certain selections.
```


## Final Step: Submit your Dataset
Click `Create dataset` at the ***bottom*** of the page to submit your dataset.


```{note}
There are also other fields on the dataset creation page that are automatically generated by the platform, such as **Dataset Identifier**, **Dataset Creator** amd **Access Rights**. These fields cannot be changed.

# Exploring dataset

## &#10147; Dataset Home Page
Once a dataset has been created, Data Catalog will display the dataset home page,
which includes:

* The **Name** & **Description**: A summary of what the dataset is about.
* **Resources**: These are the actual files or links that contain the data, which can be added after creating the dataset.
* **Metadata**: Information like the creator, visibility, project title, dataset type, etc. 

In the Dataset Home page, you can also find:

* **Manage button:** Located on the top-right corner of the page. From here, you can **update** or **delete** a dataset.

(_For detailed instructions, see [**Manage Datasets**](this_is_the_manage_datasets_reference_point) section._)


```{note} 
Similar to projects, if you are interested in a dataset, you can choose to follow it by clicking the `Follow`  button located in the ***top-left sidebar*** on the dataset's home page. This allows you to receive notifications about any updates or changes.

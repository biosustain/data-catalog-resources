# Exploring Dataset
This section provides an overview of the Datasets home page.

## &#10147; Dataset Home Page
After creating a dataset, Data Catalog displays the Datasets home page,
which includes:

* The **Name** & **Description**: A summary of what the dataset is about.
* **Resources**: These are the actual files or links that contain the data, which can be added after creating the dataset.
* **Metadata**: Includes information like the creator, visibility, project title, dataset type, etc. 

The Datasets home page also includes:

* `Manage` button: Located on the top-right corner of the page. From here, you can **update** or **delete** a dataset.

(_For detailed instructions, see [**Manage Datasets**](this_is_the_manage_datasets_reference_point) section._)


```{note} 
Similar to projects, you can follow a dataset. Click on the `Follow` button on the ***top-left sidebar*** of the Datasets home page to receive notifications about updates or changes made to the dataset.

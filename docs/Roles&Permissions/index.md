# Roles & Permissions
Data Catalog uses a **Roles & Permissions** system to manage what each user is allowed to do on the platform. This system ensures that only the right people can perform certain actions, helping keep your data secure and well-organized. For example, roles determine who can create, edit or delete datasets, and projects.

Roles & Permissions in Data Catalog are structured as follows:

```{toctree}

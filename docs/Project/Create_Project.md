#  Create a New Project

This guide walks you through the essential steps to create a project in the Data Catalog. 
Creating a project is **simple** and **flexible** and all users can create projects.

```{tip}
Keep in mind that you can update the project metadata at **any time**.
```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Projects Overview Page 
* Click the **`Projects`** button on the Data Catalog welcome page 

    **or** 
    
* Use the **`Projects`** tab located at the top of any page.

Both options will take you to the Projects overview page, where you can browse, or create a new project.





## Step 2: Add a New Project
On the Projects overview page, click the **`Add a new project`** button located right below the ***Search*** bar.



## Step 3: Fill in Project Metadata
Complete all the required fields marked with **`*`**:

* Project Title (**`*`**)
* Project Description (**`*`**)
* Access Rights: (**`*`**)
    * BRIGHT-visible: Project metadata are visible (read access) to all BRIGHT employees.
    * Restricted: Only visible to people who are granted read access.
* Principal Investigator (PI) (**`*`**)


```{admonition} Access Rights and Visibility
:class: toggle
:collapsible:

Projects have two access rights settings:

→ **BRIGHT-visible:** Project metadata is visible (read-only) to all BRIGHT employees. However, visibility of datasets depends on each dataset's individual access rights.

→ **Restricted:** The project is only visible to users who have been explicitly granted read access.

By default, projects are set to **BRIGHT-visible**, but you can change the access rights when creating or editing a project.


```

## Final Step: Complete Project Creation
Click **`Create project`** at the ***bottom*** of the page to complete the process.

```{note}
Some fields on the project creation page are automatically generated by the system, such as **Project Identifier**, **Date Created**, **Project Creator**, **Project Status**, and **Access Rights**. Some of these fields cannot be edited.

#  Create a New Project

This guide walks you through the essential steps to create a project in the Data Catalog. 
Creating a project is **simple** and **flexible**, all users can create projects, and you can always update the project metadata later if needed.

```{tip}
Keep in mind that you can update the project metadata at **any time**.
```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Projects Overview Page 
* Click the **`Projects`** button on the Data Catalog welcome page <br/>
    **or** <br/>
* Use the **`Projects`** tab located at the top of any page.

Both options will take you to the Projects overview page, where you can browse, or create a new project.



## Step 2: Add a New Project
On the Projects overview page, click the **`Add a new project`** button located right below the ***Search*** bar.



## Step 3: Fill in Project Metadata
Complete all the required fields marked with **`*`**:

* Project Title
* Project Description
* Principal Investigator (PI)




```{tip}
While only a few fields are required to create a project, we **strongly recommend** filling in additional fields, based on any relevant information you may have.

Providing more context helps ensure your project is easier to **understand**, **discover**, and **reuse**, both for yourself and others.

Even if you're unsure about some details, you can always **include what you know** and **update the project info later** if needed.
```



## Final Step: Submit your Project
Click **`Create project`** at the ***bottom*** of the page to submit your project.




```{note}
Some fields on the project creation page are automatically generated by the system, such as **Project Identifier**, **Date Created**, **Project Creator**, **Project Status**, and **Access Rights**. These fields are system-defined and cannot be edited.
```

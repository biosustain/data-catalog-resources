#  Create a New Project

This guide walks you through the essential steps to create a project in the Data Catalog. 
Creating a project is **simple** and **flexible**, all users can create projects, and you can always update the project metadata later if needed.

```{tip}
Keep in mind that you can update the project metadata at **any time**.
```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Projects Overview Page 
* Click the **`Projects`** button on the Data Catalog welcome page <br/>
    **or** <br/>
* Use the **`Projects`** tab located at the top of any page.

Both options will take you to the Projects overview page, where you can browse, or create a new project.



## Step 2: Add a New Project
On the Projects overview page, click the **`Add a new project`** button located right below the ***Search*** bar.



## Step 3: Fill in Project Metadata
Complete all the required fields marked with **`*`**:

* Project Title
* Project Description
* Principal Investigator (PI)



## Final Step: Submit your Project
Click `Create project` at the ***bottom*** of the page to submit your project.


```{note}
There are also other fields on the project creation page that are automatically generated by the platform, such as **Project Identifier**, **Data Created**, **Project Creator**, **Project Status**, **Access Rights**. These fields cannot be changed.

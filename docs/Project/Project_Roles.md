# Adding Members & Assigning Roles to a Project
In the Data Catalog, **Projects** are used to organize datasets and manage access. As a creator of a project you can add members to the associate project and assign roles. Each user can have a specific **role** within a Project, which determines what they can see and do.
Each dataset belongs to a single Project, and the project controls who can view, edit, or manage those datasets.
This guide walks you through the steps for adding members and assigning roles them.

When someone is added to a Project, they are assigned a **role** that defines what they can do:



```{table}
|  Role name  |              Permissions (in a project where user belongs)             |
|------------ |-------------|
|  **Member** | <br>• Can **view** private datasets |
|  **Editor** |  Can do everything a Member can, plus:<br>•  **Add** new datasets to the Project<br>•  **Edit** or **delete** any dataset in the Project<br>•  **Change** a dataset's **visibility** (public or private) |
|  **Admin**  |  • Can do everything an Editor can, plus:<br>•  **Add** or **remove** users from the Project<br>•  **Assign** or **change** user roles (Member, Editor, Admin)<br>•  **Edit** Project details (title, description, etc.)<br>•  **Delete** the Project (if needed) |



```

```{note}
When you create a new Project, you automatically becomes its **Admin**. This means you have full control over the Project, including its datasets and members.

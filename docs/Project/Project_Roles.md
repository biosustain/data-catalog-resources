# Add Project Members

Projects in Data Catalog help organize datasets and manage access. Each dataset belongs to a single project, and as a creator of a project, you can add members and assign roles that control who can view, edit, or manage those datasets.

The following steps show you how to add members and assign roles within a project.

## Step 1: Find & Open your Project
Click the `Projects` tab in the top navigation bar and select the project you want to add members to.

_For detailed instructions on how to do this, see the [**Search** (Using the top Navigation Bar)](this_is_the_Navigation_bar_Search_reference_point) guide._


```{note}
When you create a new project, you automatically become its **Admin**. This means you have full control over the project, including its datasets and members.
```


## Step 2: Open the Collaborators Tab
From the Project home page, click `Manage` in the ***top-right corner***, then select the `Collaborators` tab .

:class: toggle

Each user in a Project has a role that determines their access level:


```{table}
|  Role name  |              Permissions (in a Project where user belongs)             |
|------------ |-------------|
|  **Member** | <br>• Can **view** private datasets |
|  **Editor** |  Can do everything a Member can, plus:<br>•  **Add** new datasets to the Project<br>•  **Edit** or **delete** any dataset in the Project<br>•  **Change** a dataset's **visibility** (public or private) |
|  **Admin**  |  • Can do everything an Editor can, plus:<br>•  **Add** or **remove** users from the Project<br>•  **Assign** or **change** user roles (Member, Editor, Admin)<br>•  **Edit** Project details (title, description, etc.)<br>•  **Delete** the Project (if needed) |

```


## Step 4: Fill out Collaborator Info
Search for the user by username, select their role, and click `Add Collaborator` to save them.

## Update or Delete Project Members

After adding members to a project, you can either **edit** their role or **remove/delete** them if they no longer need access to the project and its dataset.

To edit a project member, go to the **Project Collaborators View page**, where all the project members are listed. Click the <img src="../../_static/images/tool.png" alt="tool" style="height:1em; vertical-align:0.002em;"> icon to open the edit page and update a member's role or delete them.

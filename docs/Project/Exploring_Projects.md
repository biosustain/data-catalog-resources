# Exploring Projects

The **Projects** section in the Data Catalog is designed to help you manage research projects efficiently. It includes two main views:

* **Projects Overview Page**, where you can search, and create new projects.
* **Project Home Page**, where you manage the details of a specific project, including metadata, linked datasets, and the Data Management Plan (DMP).



## ➤ Projects Overview Page

This is the starting point for navigating all research projects. 

### ➣ Key Features of the Projects Overview Page
From the Projects Overview Page, you can:

* **Search** 

    * Use the search bar to find specific projects.

* **Create new Project**

    * Click the `Add a new project` button to start creating a new research project.

* **View Active & Archived Projects**

    * Use the tabs at the top of the page to switch between active and archived projects, for better organization and visibility.

## ➤ Project Home Page

The **Project Home Page** in Data Catalog is the central place to view and manage everything related to a specific research project. It brings together all the essential information such as:

   * Metadata
   * Datasets
   * <span style="color:#999999">Permissions (coming soon)</span>
   * <span style="color:#999999">History (coming soon)</span>
   * Data Management Plan (DMP)

for a specific project, into one organized interface.

```{note}
The **Permissions** and **History** features are currently visible but not active. They will be available soon, allowing you to manage project users and view project activity.
```


### Inside the Project Home Page

Once you open a project, you will land on its home page. This page is structured into several key areas to help you explore and manage project details.

#### ➣ Project Title & Description

At the top of the page, there is the title and a short description of the project to help you quickly understand its purpose or scope.

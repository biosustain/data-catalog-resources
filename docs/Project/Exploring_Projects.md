# Exploring Projects
The **Project Home Page** in Data Catalog is the central place to view and manage everything related to a specific research project. It brings together all the essential components such as:<br/>
   * Metadata
   * Datasets
   * Members
   * History <br/>

for a specific project, into one organized interface.

```{note}
The **Members** and **History** features are currently visible but not active. They will be available soon, allowing you to manage project members and view project activity.

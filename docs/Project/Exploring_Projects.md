# Exploring projects

## Project Home Page
The project home page includes:

* **Datasets**: A place where you describe your data before adding the actual files or links.
* **Metadata**: Information like the creator, visibility, project title, dataset type, etc. 

In the Project Home page you can also find:

* **Add Dataset button:** Located just above the search field. Use this to add new datasets to the project. (_For more details, see [**Add a Dataset** (Method A)](this_is_the_add_datasets_reference_point)_)
* **Manage button:** Located in the top-right corner of the page. From here, you can **update** or **delete** a project. (_See also [**Manage Projects**](this_is_the_manage_projects_reference_point)_)




```{note} 
If you are interested in a project, you can choose to follow it by clicking the `Follow`  button located in the ***top-left sidebar*** on the project's home page. This allows you to receive notifications about any updates or changes.

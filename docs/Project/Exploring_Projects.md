# Exploring Projects
This section provides an overview of the Project home page.

## âž¤ Project Home Page
The project home page includes:

* **Datasets:** A place where you describe your data before uploading files or adding external links (the actual data).
* **Metadata:** Includes information such as the creator, visibility, project title, dataset type, etc. 

The Project home page also includes the following features:

* `Add Dataset`: Located just above the search field. Use this to add new datasets to the project. (_For more details, see [**Add a Dataset** (Method A)](this_is_the_add_datasets_method_A_reference_point)_)
* `Manage`: Located in the top-right corner of the page. From here, you can **update** or **delete** a project. (_See also [**Manage Projects**](this_is_the_manage_projects_reference_point)_)

# Manage Projects

This guide shows you how to manage Data Catalog Projects to keep research data structured and accessible. After a project is created, you can either **edit** its details or **archive** it. 
<br/>

➤ *Follow the steps below based on the action you want to perform.*


## Step 1: Find the project
Use the search bar in the ***top navigation*** to find your project.


## Step 2: Choose an Action
On the Project home page, you will find two action buttons:

* Click **`Edit`**, located ***right above*** the list of project metadata, to update project details <br>
    **or**<br/>        
* Click **`Archive`**, located on the ***top-right corner** of the page, to archive the project



## Step 3: Confirm
➤ If you choose to **`Edit`**: <br/>
After making the necessary updates, click:
   * **`Save`** to apply your changes <br/>
        **or**<br/> 
   * **`Cancel`** to discard them<br/>

➤ If you choose to **`Archive`**:  <br/>
A confirmation box appears, asking you to confirm your action.  <br/>
<br/>

 
```{note} 
Archived projects remain visible under the **Archived** section on the Projects Overview page. You can open and view them, but they cannot be edited unless you first click the **`Restore`** button on the project home page.

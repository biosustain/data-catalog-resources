# Manage Projects

This guide shows you how to manage Data Catalog Projects to keep research data structured and accessible. After a project is created, you can either **edit** its details or **archive** it. 


➤ *Follow the steps below based on the action you want to perform.*


## Step 1: Find the Project
Use the search bar in the ***top navigation*** to find your project. Just type the project name and, if needed, add filters to narrow things down.


## Step 2: Choose an Action
On the Project home page, you will find two action buttons:

* Click **`Edit metadata`**, located ***right above*** the list of project metadata, to update project details

    **or**

* Click **`Archive`**, located on the ***top-right corner*** of the page, to archive the project



## Step 3: Confirm
➤ If you choose to **`Edit`**: 

After making the necessary updates, click:
   * <span style="color:#00C48C">Save</span> to apply your changes

       **or**

   * <span style="color:#FF4D4F">Cancel</span> to discard them


➤ If you choose to **`Archive`**: 

A confirmation box will appear asking you to confirm the action.

Archived projects remain visible under the **Archived** section on the Projects Overview page. You can open and view them, but they cannot be edited unless you first click the **`Restore`** button on the project home page.

# Add file

Once your dataset has been successfully created in Data Catalog, you can now add files or directories to it. The files section is where you can upload and organize your data files related to your dataset.
It supports multiple upload options for flexibility.


## Step 1: Find & Open your Dataset
Click on the **`Datasets`** tab in the top navigation bar, then use the search bar to locate and open the dataset you want to add a file to.

## Step 2: Upload files
You have three options:
* **`Drag & Drop`** files from your computer into the upload area
* Click **`Choose files`** to select individual files from your local storage
    or
* Click **`Choose directory`** to upload an entire folder (ideal for keeping related files together)


➤ Once uploaded, files will appear in the list with details such as **name**, and **upload date**, making it easy to keep track its content.

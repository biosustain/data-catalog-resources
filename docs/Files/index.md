# Files

A file in Data Catalog is the lowest-level data entity managed by the system. It is stored within the dataset and represents a single piece of data such as raw data, processes data, or results in various formats (e.g., .csv, .fastq, .tiff). Each file is uniquely identified and linked to each dataset for easy management.

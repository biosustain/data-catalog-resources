# Delete a Project
Projects can also be **deleted** if no longer needed.
To delete a project, follow the next steps:

 ```{tip} 
 The first two steps for **Deleting** a project are the **same** as those used for **Updating** a project.
```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Project Home Page 
Use the search bar on the Data Catalog welcome page to find your project.

:align: center

*Data Catalog Welcome Page*

```


## Step 2: Click "Manage" 
On the Project home page, click `Manage` button located in the ***top-right corner***.

```{figure} ../../../_static/images/manage_button.png

```






```{note}
When you **delete** a project, it is **not permanently removed**. It will be hidden, and it will no longer appear in any search results. If you need the project to be **completely deleted**, please contact the **Data Catalog Administrator**.
```


## Step 3: Delete Project
Click the `Delete` button located on the ***bottom-left corner*** of the page.


```{figure} ../../../_static/images/delete_project.png

```


## Step 4: Confirm Action
To complete the deletion of the project, select `Confirm` in the dialog box that appears.

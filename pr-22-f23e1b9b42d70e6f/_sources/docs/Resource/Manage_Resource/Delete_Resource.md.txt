# Delete Resources
Resources can also be **deleted** if no longer needed.
To delete a resource, follow the next steps:

 ```{tip} 
 The first step for **Deleting** a resource is the **same** as the one used for **Updating** a resource.
```

## Step 1: Navigate to the Resources Overview Page
Start by ***finding your dataset*** and opening the ***Manage Dataset Page***. Then click the `Resources` button.

_For detailed instructions on how to do this, follow **Steps 1-3** in the [**Update Dataset**](this_is_the_reference_point) guide._

```{note}
**Deleting** a resource works the same way as deleting a project or dataset: it is **not permanently removed**. It will be hidden, and it will no longer appear in any search results. If a resource needs to be **completely deleted**, please contact the **Data Catalog Administrator**.
```


## Step 3: Confirm Action
To complete the deletion of the resource, select `Confirm` in the dialog box that appears.
